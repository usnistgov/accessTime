    """
    Evaluate expected probability of successful delivery (PSuD).
    
    Evaluates the every word critical (EWC) PSuD, which requires an 
    uninterrupted chain of keywords above the intelligibility threshold. Here
    the threshold is fixed at 0.5.

    Parameters
    ----------
    p_a : float
        Probability transitioning into a transmitting state.
    p_r : float
        Probability of remaining in a transmitting state.
    interval : float
        How often state transitions are evaluated.
    message_length : float
        Length of message in seconds.

    Returns
    -------
    float:
        Probability that the message was successfully delivered.

    Examples
    --------
    Evaluate the PSuD when P_a = P_r = 0.5, with an interval of 1 for a three
    second long message.

class PBI:
    """
    Probabilityiser for simulating probablistic channel drops.

    This class allows simple simulations of a channel that has two states:
    transmitting and not transmitting. Using the probability of returning to
    the transmitting state given it is not transmitting, P_a, and the
    probability of remaining in the transmitting state given it is
    transmitting, P_r, a faulty channel can be simulated.

    Parameters
    ----------
    P_a1 : float, optional
        Probability of initializing the transmission. The default is 1.
    P_a2 : float, optional
        Probability of returning ot a transmitting state once the transmitting
        state has been reached and it has returned to a non-transmitting
        state. The default is None. In this case P_a2 is set to be equal to
        P_a1.
    P_r : float, optional
        Probability of remaining in a transmitting state. The default is 1.
    interval : float, optional
        How often the channel state is reevaluated, in seconds. The default is
        1.

    Attributes
    ----------
    P_a1 : float, optional
        Probability of initializing the transmission. The default is 1.
    P_a2 : float, optional
        Probability of returning ot a transmitting state once the transmitting
        state has been reached and it has returned to a non-transmitting
        state. The default is None. In this case P_a2 is set to be equal to
        P_a1.
    P_r : float, optional
        Probability of remaining in a transmitting state. The default is 1.
    interval : float, optional
        How often the channel state is reevaluated, in seconds. The default is
        1.
    state : int
        Current state of PBI, either INVALID, G0, G1, or H (0,1,2,3
        respectively).
    state_history : list
        List of transmitting states that the PBI has been in at each interval
        cycle. Values of 0 represent non-transmitting states, values of 1
        represent transmitting states.
    STATE_INVALID : int
        Value 0 to represent invalid state reached
    STATE_G0 : int
        Value 1 to represent in initial state where transmission has not
        started.
    STATE_G1 : int
        Value 2 to represent in non-transmitting state where transmission has
        occured at least once.
    STATE_H : int
        Value 3 to represent in transmitting state.
