# PURPOSE

The purpose of this software is to measure the access delay of a push-to-talk network.
Access time generally describes time associated with the initialization and assignment
of channels upon user request to speak and has been identified as a key component of
quality of experience (QoE) in communications. NISTâ€™s PSCR division developed a method
to measure and quantify the access time of any push to talk (PTT) communication system.

**Additional details, reference the paper linked above.**

# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
- MATLAB R2018a or newer with the following toolboxes:
	- Audio System Toolbox (Audio Toolbox on R2019a and newer)
	- Signal Processing Toolbox
- R version 3.5.X or newer
    - RStudio (recommended)

    - devtool package (must be installed via `install.packages("devtools")` )

**Additional requirement information can be found in the paper.**	

# RUNNING MEASUREMENT SOFTWARE
To run the access delay test, run the test.m script. Speech will be played and recorded using the connected audio device. The raw and processed audio data is stored in a subfolder named data/. Test.m takes in a variety of optional input parameters, descriptions of these are available by typing `help test` in MATLAB when in the Access Time directory. 

Example input specifications:
`test('AudioFile', 'Filepath\Example.wav', 'PTTStep', 0.02,'PTTRep' , 30,  'Trials', 300, 'autoStop', true, 'StopRep', 6)`

# Post Processing

# Calculating Access Time and Uncertainty
The code to calculate access time values and their associated uncertainties is in the folder accessTime, as an R package. The package can be installed via the following command in the R console: `devtools::install_git(url="git://github.com/usnistgov/accessTime", subdir = "accessTime")`.

Detailed documentation, with examples, is built into the R package. An index containing all documentation files as well as the description file can be found via the following command in the R console, after the package has been installed: `help(package="accessTime")`

The wrapper function `process_accessData(sessionFiles, cutDir)` reads in access delay data from a list of csv files given by `sessionFiles` for measurements using audio files contained in the path of `cutDir`, along with the cut points files. It reads in the data, treats it, and fits a logistic function to the treated data. It returns an accessFit object.

The functions `eval_intell(accFit, t)` and `eval_access(accFit,alpha)` evaluate accessFit objects at times and fractions of asymptotic intelligibilities respectfully. They return intelligibilities as a function of time or access delays as a function of achieved fractional asymptotic intelligibility.

A series of plotting functions are included to visualize the results from `eval_intell(...)` and `eval_access(...)`. These functions are: `plot_accessCurve(...)`, `plot_compareAccessCurves(...)`,`plot_techIntCurves(...)`,`plot_wordIntCurves(...)`. Each have their own documentation and examples.

# Microcontroller Code
The code, as well as additional instructions, for the radio interface microcontroller is located:  <https://doi.org/10.18434/M32086>. 

This code was designed to run on the MSP-EXP430F5529LP "Launch Pad" development board and compiled for the MSP430 using TI Code Composer Studio. The microcontroller code sets up a virtual COM port over USB and provides a simple command line interface. This code is compatible with the modifications attached via perfboard.

The code uses the standard TI USB library and serial drivers. On Windows 10 driver installation is not necessary. On other systems the appropriate driver may need to be downloaded from TI.

# Volume Settings
Volume settings can impact test audio quality. To run the volume setting procedure, run the volume_adjust.m script. The output of this script gives the ideal volume settings for Vtx.

Example input specifications: `volume_adjust('AudioFile','Filepath\Example.wav','Trials',100, 'DevVolume', -5, 'Lim', [-30, 0])`
