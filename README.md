# PURPOSE

The purpose of this software is to measure the access delay of a push-to-talk (PTT) network.
Access time generally describes time associated with the initialization and assignment
of channels upon user request to speak and has been identified as a key component of
quality of experience (QoE) in communications. NISTâ€™s PSCR division developed a method
to measure and quantify the access time of any PTT communication system.

# RUNNING MEASUREMENT SOFTWARE

The easiest way to use the measurement system is to run the GUI (https://github.com/usnistgov/mcvqoe).

# Post Processing

# Calculating Access Time and Uncertainty

If access time is run through the GUI, the user will be guided through the 
process of calculating access time. Using the GUI is the recomended way, but it
can also be done by running the following python code:

```
eval_obj = mcvqoe.accesstime.evaluate(filepaths)
mean, ci = eval_obj.eval(alpha=0.9)
```

Where `filepaths` is a list that contains the path to the .csv files from the 
test to evaluate.

# Microcontroller Code
The code, as well as additional instructions, for the radio interface microcontroller is located:  <https://doi.org/10.18434/M32086>. 

This code was designed to run on the MSP-EXP430F5529LP "Launch Pad" development board and compiled for the MSP430 using TI Code Composer Studio. The microcontroller code sets up a virtual COM port over USB and provides a simple command line interface. This code is compatible with the modifications attached via perfboard.

The code uses the standard TI USB library and serial drivers. On Windows 10 driver installation is not necessary. On other systems the appropriate driver may need to be downloaded from TI.
